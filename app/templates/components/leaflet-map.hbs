{{yield}}

{{#each location in locations}}
    {{! I usually wrap with a conditional to observe something like location.onMap }}
    {{leaflet-marker location=location map=map action="markerClicked"}}

    {{! a conditional for location.popUpOpen saves us from needlessly rendering the popup }}
    {{leaflet-popup location=location action="popUpClicked"}}
